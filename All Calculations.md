## Site Survey
Site is Shariatpur- latitude :23.2866, longitude:90.3748 Co-ordinates- N 23 17’12’’ , E 90 22’ 29’’
Crop in focus- potato
Tentative land size – 50000 square meters
The species chosen is  a 90-95 days crop
1. The crop has water requirements = 4000 m<sup>3</sup> / ha in its lifetime of 95 days ( max chosen)
Now , 1 ha ( hectare) = 10000 square meter
So,50000 square meters= 5 ha
2. So, water requirement for the crop = 20000  m<sup>3</sup>
So, per day water requirement= 20000/95 =210.5  m<sup>3</sup>=55608.217 gallons =210500 liter

## Pump Requirements
- We select  surface pump and AC coupling for the system.
- We choose a reference total dynamic head ( TDH) of 140 feet = 42.672 meters ( generally in Bangladesh we have systems with dynamic head between 20 and 80 meters) 
- Potato is generally cultivated in winter seasons. We will consider the daily solar radiation values or peak sun hour values for months of Nov-Jan. For PV sizing- we take data of December when the peak sun hour is the lowest.The Data are derived from online solar radiation databases based on the site coordinates.

| Month 	| Daily Solar Radiation-horizontal KWh/m<sup>2</sup>/d  	|
|:-----:	|:-------------------------------------------:	|
|  Nov  	|                     4.28                    	|
|  Dec  	|                     4.21                    	|
|  Jan  	|                     4.36                    	|

## Pump Sizing
1. Water requirement=55608.217 gallons/day
2. Solar insolation for December=4.21 KWh/m<sup>2</sup>/day or a solar insolation level of 4.21 hr/day
3. We have, flow rate = 55608.217/4.21=13208.6 gallons(ga)/hr or 220.14 ga/min (gpm)
4. Surface pumps used in solar irrigation are of centrifugal type. We now consult performance curve of surface pump from a manufacturer- Holland Applied Technologies. For the model **Waukesha C216-3500**, we get peak pump input power of 15 HP = 11190 W for a pump head (TDH) of 140 feet and water requirement of 220.14 gpm.
This will be the output required from PV installation.

## Planned PV System

## PV Installation Sizing

To find the peak PV power; we have to consider all the losses related to this PV system-
- PV efficiency= 0.85
- Cable efficiency=0.98
- Inverter efficiency = 0.90
- Panel soiling factor= 0.90

So, required power of PV installation= 11190/(0.98 x 0.85 x 0.90 x 0.90)=16.5 KWp

## Inverter Sizing
Inverter Rating = Total AC Load + 25%= 11190/0.8=13987.5 W
We choose 14 KW
